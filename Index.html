        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. From the
        coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then
        roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into a powder and
        typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

        French (alt. Turkish, Dark, Espresso) is the name applied to a degree of roast of coffee beans resulting in a dark brown
        coffee bean. In this roast, the beans are well into the second crack. French roasted beans will have a dark brown color
        and a shiney surface from its oils.

    <p style="width:50%">
        Colombian coffee also has a dark roast used to make rich espresso blends. Remember that the roast of the coffee isn't
        actually related to the growth of the coffee. Colombia is famous for its coffee beans, which can be used to make both
        light roasts and dark roasts.
